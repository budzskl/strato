05:24 - Decided to restart and redo this app. spent a while today setting up the backend and frontend, connecting them properly. spent way too much time tryng to figure out why the two werent connecting, turned out someothing on my mac was alrady using the port i was running the backend on, and would result in failures. hoping to get back to develop and create the actual calendar and task systems. i want to first finish creating the backend stuff, like the tasks and how they will work befor ecreating and polishing the frontend. next on my list is to create the task system in the backend.
